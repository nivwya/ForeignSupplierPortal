## About The Project

https://github.com//assets/

Developed during my **Summer Internship** to streamline communication between foreign suppliers and the procurement team. The portal allows vendors to manage **purchase orders, delivery schedules, invoices, payments, and profiles** ‚Äî all in one place.
The system is integrated with **SAP** for real-time enterprise data syncing and features secure authentication, dynamic reporting, and profile management for vendors.
