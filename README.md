## About The Project
<img src="https://github.com/nivwya/ForeignSupplierPortal/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-18%20200952.png">

Developed during my **Summer Internship** to streamline communication between foreign suppliers and the procurement team. The portal allows vendors to manage **purchase orders, delivery schedules, invoices, payments, and profiles** â€” all in one place.
The system is integrated with **SAP** for real-time enterprise data syncing and features secure authentication, dynamic reporting, and profile management for vendors, admins and super-admins.
