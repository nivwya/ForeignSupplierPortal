# ForeignSupplierPortal
Developed during my Summer Internship, this web application streamlines vendor interactions by enabling foreign suppliers to manage orders, deliveries, invoices, payments, and profiles through a single unified platform. Built with Laravel (PHP), MySQL, and JavaScript, and integrated with SAP systems for seamless data exchange.
